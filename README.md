  <h3>Latest opinion about me: (Feb 2024)</h3>
  <i>Grzegorz has completed a one-year course as a full-stack programmer. He has worked in C#, .NET Core technology. He has a good knowledge of algorithms and knows how to work correctly with git. He is a person who takes initiative in programming over the whole group. However, he often hesitates to express his thoughts, affecting his speech fluency during technical discussions. He has a good coding base in OOP. He is a good candidate for working on the backend, solving tasks, and finding bugs in code.</i><br>
